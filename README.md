## üß† Overview

Q-CMAPO is a novel hybrid framework that integrates **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA)** with **Classical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to address the long-standing **exploration‚Äìexploitation dilemma**. The framework is validated through extensive simulations across various real-world UAV deployment scenarios including:

- Urban Surveillance  
- Forest Fire Monitoring  
- 5G Coverage Optimization  
- Disaster Response  
- Wildlife Tracking

## üî¨ Key Features

- Quantum-inspired exploration using QAOA with reward-weighted QUBO formulation.
- Classical MARL backbone based on actor-critic algorithms and CTDE.
- Built-in ablation, sensitivity, and scalability analysis.
- Visual explainability via attention heatmaps and convergence diagnostics.
- ROS-compatible modules for physical deployment on UAV systems.
